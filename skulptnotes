Notes and rules for python implemented through skulpt.org

#1 version
    Python 2.2
#2 compiler?

#3 output
    output frame is built into page, there is also console window 
    application through raw_input() and the like.
#4 iteration
    word="word" 
    print word#[0:2]
    this works just fine, but try printing a slice the same, and the
    program wont run. Must use a loop to iterate through the string.
    word="word"
    for i in word: print word[0:2]
