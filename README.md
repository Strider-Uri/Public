Prototype Mars crew planner:

Human expansion technique has slanted toward a ratio of noncombatant personnel / combantants > 1 = True
A startling reality where technology becomes the combat effectiveness and not the human capacity for 
warfare. In Rome, China, and Tribal communities worldwide, we have historical accounts of military might,
and in the 1700's to today, militaries still have capable warriors who train for the unique ability to
conduct war. 
Why then do we not spread our home by the sword anymore? And are we alone in this pursuit, or will our
strangers feel likewise when we cross paths? 

I somehow dont envy the phaser-weilding trekkie his conflict.
