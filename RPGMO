Operative functions for game drivers
perhaps using java?

Math.round(Math.random()*2); //for quest rewards

""" defence algorithm """
Using the following variables:

str = attacker's strength
acc = attacker's accuracy
pow = attacker's power
aim = attacker's aim
def = target defense
arm = target armor
And the following functions:

Random() - gives a random number between 0 and 1
Max(a, b) - equal to "a" or "b", whichever is larger
Ceiling(a) - gives the smallest integer equal or larger than "a"
Damage is calculated as follows:

tot_str = str + pow / 2
tot_acc = acc + aim / 2
tot_def = def + arm / 3
if combat style is aggressive, tot_str = tot_str + 1
if combat style is defensive, tot_acc = tot_acc + 1
if combat style is accurate, tot_def = tot_def + 1
temp_damage = 1 + (tot_str / 5) * Random()
temp_defense = Max(0, tot_def - tot_acc) * Random()
final_damage = Max(0, Ceiling(temp_damage - temp_defense))
